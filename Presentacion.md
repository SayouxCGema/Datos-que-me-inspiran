# Welcome to my profile!

I am just starting my career as a data analyst and I am very excited if you have come this far, to read my profile.

My name is 
<b>Gema Calder√≥n Sayoux<b>

I started in this data world during the pandemic, but I was initially focused on SEO. After that, marketing analytics became too small for me and I started doing different trainings to get better information about the data.

I am currently still training as a data analyst and I think I could be in academia forever, as this sector never stops growing. 

I would like to take this opportunity to share my work and findings and perhaps they will be of help to others.
